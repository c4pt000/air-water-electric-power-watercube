(earlier mention of using air for propellant....watercube makes this easier to convert air into water output to seperate water output into combustible gas to power electric vehicles)

watercube makes water from the AIR 5 gallons every hour (120 gallons every 24 hours)

water goes into a 40 gal fuel tank

the water is fed through a pump into a 5 gallon mini-tank

the mini tank has a 120v for the negative anode to produce oxygen gas (and the positive cathode produces hydrogen gas)

and the 120v electrical terminals are submerged inside of the 5 gallon tank with two gas outputs to sepeate the combustibile gas output from the 5 gallon tank

the gas output is collected from the two outputs inside of a pressurized gaseous tank to store gaseous compounds

the pressuried tank collecting the gaseous output is then fed into a crank shaft generator that burns and combusts the oxygen and hydrogen gas

to power an electrical generator to generate electricity for a car, or otherwise (even possibly an airplane or other aerial craft or even oceanic equipment or vessels)

air input into Watercube system .... watercube system produce 5 gallons output every hour and pushes the 5 gallons into a 40 gallon liquid water tank

a water pump pushs 5 gallons of water into a 5 gallon liquid tank with two electric terminals submerged inside of the 5 gallon tank to produce oxygen and hydrogen gas output

the hydrogen gas and water gaseous output is collected into a pressurized gaseous tank 

the gaseous tank holding oxygen and hydrogen (as a split seperate chamber of raw oxygen only and raw hydrogen only) is then fed though a hose to burn and combust inside of an electric generator

which powers the electric generator to produce energy to power the vehicle from air and water
